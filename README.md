## üéØ Problem Statement
**ID25216: AI-Driven Pollution Source Identification, Forecasting & Policy Dashboard for Delhi-NCR**

The air pollution crisis in Delhi-NCR is a complex, seasonal, and multi-faceted challenge. It's driven by a combination of factors including agricultural stubble burning, high vehicular density, industrial emissions, and specific meteorological conditions. Existing tools often lack the necessary granularity to identify pollution sources in real-time and fail to provide actionable insights for both citizens and policymakers. This results in reactive, blanket policies that are often less effective and cause widespread disruption.

## üí° Our Solution: Project AQURA
**AQURA (Air Quality & Urban Resilience Analytics)** is a unified software platform that bridges the information gap between pollution data and decisive action. By leveraging satellite imagery, ground-sensor data, and advanced AI/ML models, AQURA provides a high-resolution view of the air quality landscape.

Our platform offers two tailored interfaces:
* A **Citizen App** to empower the public with personalized, hyperlocal information to protect their health.
* A **Policy Dashboard** to equip government agencies with the data-driven tools needed to craft precise, effective, and evidence-based interventions.

Our goal is to transform air quality management from a reactive guessing game into a proactive, data-centric science.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### For Citizens (Mobile & Web App) üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
* **Hyperlocal AQI:** Real-time and forecasted AQI for your exact location, not just a city-wide average.
* **Personalized Health Alerts:** Customizable push notifications based on health profiles (e.g., asthma, elderly, children) when air quality deteriorates.
* **Safe Route Planner:** Integrates with maps to suggest the least polluted routes for commuting, jogging, or walking.
* **Source Awareness:** Simple, intuitive graphics showing the primary causes of pollution on any given day.

### For Policymakers (Policy Dashboard) üèõÔ∏è
* **Real-time Source Apportionment:** Interactive heatmaps and charts showing the percentage contribution of different pollution sources (e.g., Stubble Burning vs. Traffic vs. Industrial) across the NCR.
* **AI-Powered Forecasting:** Accurate 24-72 hour AQI forecasts to anticipate pollution events and act preemptively.
* **Intervention Effectiveness Simulator:** A "what-if" analysis tool to model the potential impact of policies (like the odd-even scheme or construction bans) before implementation.
* **AI-Generated Recommendations:** Actionable suggestions for targeted interventions based on real-time data and forecast models.
