## üéØ Problem Statement
**ID25216: AI-Driven Pollution Source Identification, Forecasting & Policy Dashboard for Delhi-NCR**

The air pollution crisis in Delhi-NCR is a complex, seasonal, and multi-faceted challenge. It's driven by a combination of factors including agricultural stubble burning, high vehicular density, industrial emissions, and specific meteorological conditions. Existing tools often lack the necessary granularity to identify pollution sources in real-time and fail to provide actionable insights for both citizens and policymakers. This results in reactive, blanket policies that are often less effective and cause widespread disruption.

## üí° Our Solution: Project AQURA
**Delhi-NCR Air Quality Intelligence** is a unified software platform that bridges the information gap between pollution data and decisive action. By leveraging satellite imagery, ground-sensor data, and advanced AI/ML models, AQURA provides a high-resolution view of the air quality landscape.

Our platform offers two tailored interfaces:
* A **Citizen App** to empower the public with personalized, hyperlocal information to protect their health.
* A **Policy Dashboard** to equip government agencies with the data-driven tools needed to craft precise, effective, and evidence-based interventions.

Our goal is to transform air quality management from a reactive guessing game into a proactive, data-centric science.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### For Citizens (Mobile & Web App) üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
* **Hyperlocal AQI:** Real-time and forecasted AQI for your exact location, not just a city-wide average.
* **Personalized Health Alerts:** Customizable push notifications based on health profiles (e.g., asthma, elderly, children) when air quality deteriorates.
* **Safe Route Planner:** Integrates with maps to suggest the least polluted routes for commuting, jogging, or walking.
* **Source Awareness:** Simple, intuitive graphics showing the primary causes of pollution on any given day.

### For Policymakers (Policy Dashboard) üèõÔ∏è
* **Real-time Source Apportionment:** Interactive heatmaps and charts showing the percentage contribution of different pollution sources (e.g., Stubble Burning vs. Traffic vs. Industrial) across the NCR.
* **AI-Powered Forecasting:** Accurate 24-72 hour AQI forecasts to anticipate pollution events and act preemptively.
* **Intervention Effectiveness Simulator:** A "what-if" analysis tool to model the potential impact of policies (like the odd-even scheme or construction bans) before implementation.
* **AI-Generated Recommendations:** Actionable suggestions for targeted interventions based on real-time data and forecast models.

## üöÄ Quick Start (MERN)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm
- MongoDB (local or Atlas URI)
- Python 3 (for the forecast endpoint)

### 1) Install dependencies
```bash
# Frontend
cd client && npm install

# Backend
cd ../server && npm install
```

### 2) Configure environment
Create a `.env` in `server/`:
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/glitchx
PORT=5000
```
For MongoDB Atlas, use your SRV connection string:
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/glitchx?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<AppName>
```

### 3) Run in development
Open two terminals:
```bash
# Terminal A - backend
cd server && npm run dev

# Terminal B - frontend
cd client && npm run dev
```
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend health: http://localhost:5000/api/health
- Frontend proxy to API: http://localhost:5173/api/health

If accessing from another device on the network:
```bash
cd client && npm run dev -- --host
```

## üß© API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` ‚Üí `{ status, db, timestamp }`
- `GET /api/db-status` ‚Üí `{ connected }`
- `GET /api/readings` ‚Üí List readings (503 if DB disconnected)
- `POST /api/readings` ‚Üí Create reading `{ locationName, latitude, longitude, so2, no2, spm }`
- `GET /api/forecast` ‚Üí Runs `predict_aqi.py` and returns stdout

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
```
GlitchX/
  client/           # React + Vite frontend
    public/         # static assets
    src/
      components/   # MapView, AQChart, Readings, Forecast
      App.jsx       # UI with tabs mirroring original site
      index.css     # Ported styles from style.css
  server/           # Express + Mongoose backend
    src/
      routes/       # readings, forecast, health
      models/       # Reading model
      index.js      # App entry
  predict_aqi.py    # Python forecast script
```

## üèóÔ∏è Production build
Front-end build:
```bash
cd client && npm run build
```
This creates `client/dist/`. To serve from Express, add static serving in `server/src/index.js` (optional), or deploy separately to a static host.

## üêû Troubleshooting
- Frontend blank/"site can‚Äôt be reached":
  - Ensure dev servers running: `client:5173`, `server:5000`.
  - If remote device: run `npm run dev -- --host` in client.
- `db":"disconnected"` in `/api/health`:
  - Start MongoDB locally or set a valid Atlas `MONGO_URI`.
  - Ensure Atlas IP allowlist includes your machine.
- `/api/readings` returns 503:
  - DB not connected; start MongoDB or fix `MONGO_URI`.
- `GET /api/forecast` errors:
  - Ensure Python 3 is installed and accessible as `python3`.

## üîê Security
- Keep credentials out of source control. Use `.env` locally and environment variables in deployment.
- Rotate any credentials shared during testing.

## ‚úÖ Scripts
Backend (`server/package.json`):
- `npm run dev` ‚Üí Nodemon dev server
- `npm start` ‚Üí Node server

Frontend (`client/package.json`):
- `npm run dev` ‚Üí Vite dev server
- `npm run build` ‚Üí Production build
- `npm run preview` ‚Üí Preview build
